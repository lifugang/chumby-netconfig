netconf - 07.12.11

this is a small qt application for the chumby device.

it uses a modified start_network perl script (located in /usr/chumby/scripts 
on your chumby) to scan for available wifi networks (via wpa_supplicant).
a (optional) wifi key / ip configuration can be done with the included 
onscreen touch-keyboard.
in the end a connection attempt is performed...when successfull your chumby
should be connected to a wifi network...*yaay!*


WARNING: there no guarantee whatsorever for this application since it's 
a work-in-progress project. 
at the moment there is a lot in-code debugging and the code is setup 
for testing on a standard-pc development machine!!

needed:
- qt 4.7+ libs

NOTE: qt should be compiled with "qvfb" support, if you want to run the 
application on a development machine...

quick make:

1. checkout 
2. run "qmake" in project dir
3. make
4. run "./chumbynetconf -qws"
